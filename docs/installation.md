# Installation Guide

E3SM is not available as a pre-compiled binary.  You install
E3SM by cloning the source code and building the executable on your local
platform.

It is recommended that you install E3SM on a supported platform.
(See [Hardware/Software Configuration](https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/4116447351/Hardware+Software+Configuration))

The E3SM Project can not assist with installation on an un-supported platform but can point you in the right direction.
If you wish to port E3SM to your machine, first check that you have
the software prerequisites detailed in
[Hardware/Software Configuration](https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/4116447351/Hardware+Software+Configuration#Software-prerequisites).
Then proceed to the [CIME Porting Guide](https://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/master/html/users_guide/porting-cime.html).  E3SM
uses the CIME Case Control System to configure and build the executable.

# Usage Guide

E3SM is not just one climate model but a modeling system that allows
many different configurations of atmosphere, ocean, land and other
components with both full model and data model options. Also, the configurations of model
components can run at different resolutions.  Some configurations
can run easily on a laptop.  Other's require the most powerful
supercomputers.

Using the model requires fist deciding what configuration to use and creating
a case with that configuration.
The configuration options are managed by the Case Control System (CCS)
within the
[Community Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth](https://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/master/html/what_cime/index.html) (CIME).

Before reading the rest of this guide, you should become familiar with
cases, compsets and grids by reading the
[Case Control System Basic Usage](https://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/master/html/users_guide/index.html#case-control-system-part-1-basic-usage)

A [step-by-step guide](https://docs.e3sm.org/running-e3sm-guide/) for running E3SM with a run script
is available.

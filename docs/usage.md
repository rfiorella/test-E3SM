# Usage Guide

E3SM is not just one climate model but a modeling system that allows
many different configurations of atmopshere, ocean, land and other
components with both full model and data model options.  Some configurations
can run easily on a laptop.  Other's require the most powerful
supercomputers.

Using the model requires fist deciding what configuration to use.
The configuration options are managed by the Case Control System (CCS)
within the
[Community Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth](https://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/master/html/what_cime/index.html) (CIME).

Start with the basic concepts and commands at
[Case Control System Basic Usage](https://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/master/html/users_guide/index.html#case-control-system-part-1-basic-usage)

A [step-by-step guide](https://docs.e3sm.org/running-e3sm-guide/) for running E3SM with a run script
is available.

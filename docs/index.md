# The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)

E3SM is a state-of-the-art fully coupled model of the Earth's climate including important biogeochemical
and cryospheric processes. It is intended to address the most challenging and demanding climate-change
research problems and Department of Energy mission needs while efficiently using DOE Leadership Computing Facilities.
